### Naive String Searching

suppose you want to count the number of times a
smaller string appears in a longer string

A StraightForward approach involves checking pairs of characters individually


"harold said haha in hamburg"

Pseudocode

Loop over the longer string 

Loop over the shorter string 

if the characters don't match , break out of the inner loop

if the characters do match, keep going

if you complete the inner loop and find a match increment the count of matches

return the count


## What is Sorting 

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection eg an array os that the items are in some kind of order.
