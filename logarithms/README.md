# Logarithms

we've encountered some of the most common complexities : O(1), O(n), O(n^2)

sometimes big O expression involve more complex mathematical expression

One that appear more often then you might like is **logarithms**

### what is Logarithms

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get value that's less than or equal to one.

### Logarithms Example
    
    log(8) = 3
    log(25) = 4.64
