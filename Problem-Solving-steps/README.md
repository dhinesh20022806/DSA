# 1. Understand the problem 

### Answer these question before write the code

1. can i restate the problem in my own words
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the output be determined from the inputs ? In Other words do i have enough information to solve the problem ?
5. How should i label the important pieces of data that ara a part of the problem

# 2. Explore concreate Example

Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better

Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solutions works how it should

### use stories! ### unit test

## 2.1 Explore with examples

starts with simple examples

progress to more complex examples

Explore example with empty inputs

Explore example with invalid inputs

# 3. Break it down 

Explicitly write out the steps you need to take ?

# 4. solve/Simpily

Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do ? 

Temporarily ignore the difficulty ?

write simplified solution ?

Then incorporate that difficult back in ?

# 5. Look back and refactor

## Refactoring questions

1. Can you check the result ?
2. Can you derive the result differently ?
3. Can you understand at a glance ?
4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem ?
5. Can you improve performance of your solution ?
6. Can you think of other ways to refactor ?
7. How have other people solve the problem ?
